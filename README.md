# M18-Gulp-Roast-Challenge
This is a challenge creating an About Us, Our Products, and Contact Us page for a fictional coffee company, Gulp Roast.
This challenge helped me practice how to code media queries, classes, links, and other basic coding techniques in HTML and CSS.

If I were to visit this project again, I would add how to change the images in the products page to a caption when hovered over them. I would also align the images.
